Download and install PHP Manager(PHPManagerForIIS_V1.5.0.msi). Download and install the Rewrite Module(rewrite_amd64_en-US.msi). Create a folder in C: named "PHP". Download  PHP 7.3.8 (php-7.3.8-nts-Win32-VC15-x86.zip). Unzip the contents into C:\PHP. Download and install  VC_redist.x86.exe. Download and install  MySQL 5.5.62 (mysql-5.5.62-win32.msi).
